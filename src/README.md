#regexcif.py source
This is where the developement files are stored. A preprocessor is used to expand repetitive sections of code to make regexcif.py, the regex engine.

If you do want to add more preprocessor directives, use the already existing one as a template. All directives should start with ##, and only use one if there is repetitive code 
that is the same every time (except for total indentation).
